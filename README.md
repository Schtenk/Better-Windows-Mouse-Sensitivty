# Better-Windows-Mouse-Sensitivty
A program for changing mouse sensitivty in windows to a more precise value than windows allows by default.

This program works by changing the "Enhance Precision" mouse settings smoothing curve to a flat curve (i.e. no mouse acceleration) based on the mouse sensitivty set in the program.
